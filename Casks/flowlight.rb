  # History, settings and caches. The content filter and the inspection certificate authority are installed by
  # macOS on the app's request, so only the app can withdraw them — hence the caveat.

  caveats <<~EOS
    If you turned on the network extension or HTTPS inspection, open Flowlight and switch them off
    before uninstalling: only the app itself can remove the system extension and the certificate it
    added to your login keychain.
